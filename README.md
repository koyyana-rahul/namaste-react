# Namaste React

# github:- 
- 1) git init => to initialize git repository
- 2) git branch -M main -> main as a default branch
- 3) git add .
- 4) git commit -m "message to the repo"
- 5) git remote add origin link
- 6) git push origin main





# npm

-  npm init => initialize package managers
-  npm install parcel => to make production code to be small we have to use parcel bundler.


- to get the local host server using parcel 
     -> npx parcel index.html(npx means executing a package)



- instead of cdn links for react we have to use npm of react

- why?

--- fetching the react from cdn is costliest operations
--- all times we have to update the versions in the cdn links(url's)


- so to eliminate cdn react links method we have to use 
--- => npm install react
